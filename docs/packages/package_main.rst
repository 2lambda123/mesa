"How To" Mesa Packages 
======================

The Mesa core functionality is just a subset of what we believe researchers creating Agent Based Models (ABMs) will use. We designed Mesa to be extensible, so that individuals from various domains can build and maintain their own Mesa packages in pursuit of "unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity." (Volker Grimm et al 2005)

The purpose of this guide is to support new programmers by providing detailed guides on "How to" build and share a package. Let's get started!
