*Supporting MESA Agent Based Modeling with Crowd Sourced Packages*  
------------------------------------------------------------------

	*Bottom up models are virtual laboratories where controlled experiments distinguish noise from signal in the systems organization....
	This approach may change our whole notion of scientific theory, which until now has been based on the theories of physics. Theories of
	complex systems may never be reducible to simple analytical equations, but are more likely to be sets of conceptually simple mechanisms
	(e.g. Darwinian natural selection) that produce different dynamics and outcomes in different contexts.*

Mesa Packages Purpose: 
----------------------


**MESA Packages is a repository to share packages for use in Agent Based Models (ABMs) in pursuit of "unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity."**

	**(1) Provide code which can be integrated into MESA ABMs to enable greater exploration of complex phenomenon.**
	
	**(2) Support new programmers by providing detailed guides on "How to" build and share a package.**


Mesa Packages Overview: 
-----------------------

Mesa Packages does not have the capacity to verify the coding, the accuracy or the effectiveness of underlying theory and its instantiation in the supplied package. To ensure supplied packages are understandable and usable please adhere to the usability and veracity guidelines. 

	You want to use a package but have no idea how -- start here: :ref:`user-guide`

	You want add your package but have never done it before -- start here:: :ref:`package-development`

**Usability Guidelines:**
	1. Package has explanatory documentation (see an example in :ref:`package-template`) 
	2. Package has a requirements document listing dependencies
	3. Package has a generic example code which any user can copy and paste to see the package work

**Veracity Guidelines:**
	1. Package cites its sources (citation style is not mandated)  
	2. Package lists any peer-reviewed journals and conferences where it has been published, presented or cited.
