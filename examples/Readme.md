# Example Code

This directory contains example models meant to test and demonstrate Mesa's features, and provide demonstrations for how to build and analyze agent-based models. For more information on each model, see its own Readme and documentation.

### Conway's Game Of Life (needs Readme)
An implementation of the Famous Pr. Conway's Game Of Life

### EpsteinCivilViolence (needs Readme)
Joshua Epstein's [model](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2002/epstein2002a.pdf) of how a decentralized uprising can be suppressed or reach a critical mass of support.

### Flockers (needs Readme)
Boids-style flocking model, demonstrating the use of agents moving through a continuous space following direction vectors.

### ForestFire
Simple cellular automata of a fire spreading through a forest of cells on a grid.

### PD_Grid
Grid-based demographic prisoner's dilemma model, demonstrating how simple mimicing can lead to the emergence of widespread cooperation -- and how a model activation regime can change its outcome.

### Schelling.py (needs Readme)
Simple implementation of the classic Schelling segregation model.

### Tutorial Bollzmann Wealth Model (needs Readme)

### WolfSheep
Implementation of a simple ecological predator Prey and Reproduction Simulation.
