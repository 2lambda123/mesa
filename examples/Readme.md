# Example Code

This directory contains example models meant to test and demonstrate Mesa's features, and provide demonstrations for how to build and analyze agent-based models. For more information on each model, see its own Readme and documentation.

### Conway's Game Of Life 
An implementation of the Famous Pr. Conway's Game Of Life
(needs readme)

### EpsteinCivilViolence 
Joshua Epstein's [model](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2002/epstein2002a.pdf) of how a decentralized uprising can be suppressed or reach a critical mass of support.
(needs readme)

### Flockers 
Boids-style flocking model, demonstrating the use of agents moving through a continuous space following direction vectors.
(needs readme)

### ForestFire
Simple cellular automata of a fire spreading through a forest of cells on a grid.

### PD_Grid
Grid-based demographic prisoner's dilemma model, demonstrating how simple mimicing can lead to the emergence of widespread cooperation -- and how a model activation regime can change its outcome.

### Schelling.py 
Simple implementation of the classic Schelling segregation model.
(needs readme)

### Tutorial Bolzmann Wealth Model 
Simple agent-based model, drawn from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to wealth distribution [Dragulescu and Yakovenko](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0211175v1.pdf)
(needs readme)

### WolfSheep
Implementation of a simple ecological predator Prey and Reproduction Simulation.
