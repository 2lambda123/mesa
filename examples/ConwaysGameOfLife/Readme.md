## Conway's Game Of "Life"

[The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), also known simply as "Life", is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input by a human. One interacts with the Game of "Life" by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.
